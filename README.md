## üéØ Problem Statement

Bhutan's transition to constitutional monarchy has achieved significant democratic milestones, yet traditional governance faces a fundamental **trilemma**: systems can be participatory, informed, or efficient‚Äîbut rarely all three simultaneously. This creates critical gaps in democratic participation:

**Traditional Centralized Challenges:**
- **Limited Authentic Representation**: Conventional representative democracy struggles to capture the nuanced values of Bhutan's diverse communities, from Buddhist monastics to Nepali-speaking southern districts across 20 dzongkhags
- **Participation Barriers**: Low political awareness, underrepresentation of youth and women, and minimal rural community engagement limit inclusive governance
- **Scalability Constraints**: Complex policy decisions and resource allocation processes cannot efficiently incorporate citizen input while maintaining democratic legitimacy

**Self-Sovereign Identity Opportunity:**
Bhutan has pioneered National Digital Identity (NDI) infrastructure that enables verified citizen participation, yet this powerful technology remains **critically underutilized** for transforming governance itself. Unlike token-based systems vulnerable to wealth concentration and Sybil attacks, NDI provides authentic "one verified citizen, one voice" foundations for legitimate digital democracy.

**Data Sovereignty Crisis:**
Citizens currently have minimal control over how their preferences, values, and policy inputs are collected, processed, and represented in governance decisions, creating disconnection between authentic community values and governmental actions.

## üí° Solution

DeepGov Bhutan creates the world's first **NDI-verified AI-assisted democratic governance system** that solves the authentication problem plaguing decentralized governance while scaling authentic citizen participation.

### **National Digital Identity Integration**
- **Verified Participation**: NDI authentication ensures "one verified citizen, one voice" eliminating Sybil attacks and fake participation common in token-based DAOs
- **Cultural Authenticity**: NDI enables demographic-aware AI representatives reflecting authentic Buddhist, Nepali, and diverse ethnic community values
- **Multilingual Access**: Native language interfaces (Dzongkha, Nepali, English) connected through verified identity for inclusive participation

### **Decentralized Architecture**
- **Configurable AI Representatives**: Citizens co-design and elect AI governance assistants for each dzongkhag and demographic group using quadratic voting mechanisms
- **Polis Consensus Integration**: Taiwan-proven "broad listening" tools identify value clusters and build consensus across polarized communities without centralized manipulation
- **Blockchain Governance**: Smart contracts on Ethereum/Polygon enable transparent, tamper-proof voting and resource allocation decisions
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Maintain privacy while ensuring verified participation and authentic representation

### **User Empowerment**
- **Data Sovereignty**: Citizens maintain complete control over their governance preferences through self-sovereign identity and encrypted personal data vaults
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Shapley value explanations show exactly how AI representatives reach recommendations, ensuring full accountability to human constituents
- **Continuous Oversight**: Regular feedback and reconfiguration processes allow citizens to update their AI representatives' values and priorities
- **Direct Democratic Input**: Integration with parliamentary processes where AI representatives synthesize citizen input for elected MPs while preserving constitutional monarchy framework

### **Innovation Factor**
DeepGov Bhutan represents the **first implementation of identity-verified, culturally-sensitive AI governance at national scale**. By solving the fundamental authentication challenge that limits most DAO governance systems, we're creating replicable infrastructure for legitimate digital democracy that amplifies rather than replaces human agency. This positions Bhutan as a global leader in authentic democratic participation while maintaining its unique constitutional heritage.

  - Self-hosted LLM option (Ollama) to avoid data sharing with external AI services
  - VPN-secured infrastructure for development and production environments

## üí¨ How to Self-Host the LLMs

For production and government-sensitive work, we recommend to self-host LLM API calls instead of relying on OpenAI API. Below we document the small changes needed to run a local open-source Llama3.1 model (or internal Dzongkha LLM) for the Telegram Bot.

### 1. Install Ollama
```bash
# Install Ollama (Linux/macOS)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull a model (e.g., llama3.1)
ollama pull llama3.1
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables
```bash
# In .env file
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key  # Comment out
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434  # Add this
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1  # Add this
```

### 3. Modify `deepgov-ndi-bot/src/openai.ts`
```typescript
// Replace OpenAI import and client
import axios from 'axios';

const OLLAMA_BASE_URL = process.env.OLLAMA_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:11434';
const OLLAMA_MODEL = process.env.OLLAMA_MODEL || 'llama3.1';

// Replace handleMessage function's OpenAI call:
const response = await axios.post(`${OLLAMA_BASE_URL}/api/generate`, {
  model: OLLAMA_MODEL,
  prompt: `${systemPrompt}\n\nUser: ${content}\nAssistant:`,
  stream: false
});

return response.data.response;
```

### 4. Update package.json (optional)
```bash
# Remove OpenAI dependency
bun remove openai
```
